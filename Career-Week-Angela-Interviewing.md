## Get Personal
* Relate specific aspects of your past experience to their current needs (identify these experiences in advance!)
  * People like to talk about themselves, so see if you can get them talking!
* It's okay to talk about your life! (Just keep it light)

## Be Engaged!
* Don't be a question-answering robot
* Interview = Conversation
* Prove that you've done your research!
  * YES: I read the article you published in Fortune magazine last month. I thought that...
  * NO: Oh hey, I noticed on Facebook that you hike in the woods with your mom on Sundays...

## Relax
* It's okay to be nervous
* Give yourself plenty of time to prepare
* Deep breaths/power poses/meditation
* Bring several copies of your resume
* Be yourself!

NOTE: Mental Practice is as effective as Actual Practice, do both!

## Behavioral Best Practices
* Stay professional

## After the Interview?!

  * Look for articles that they shared
  * Anything that's related to the company
  * Questions related to the role
* Is this a new position or is it reasonably opened
* What are things that the person that was in this position that could be opportunities for growth

## What Not to Ask in the First Interview!
* In general do not talk about salary in the first interview.
  * Unless the interviewer mentions it, I would not try to negotiate at that point.
* Speaking overly polite, Yes mam no sir, etc...
  * Depends on the company!

## What are your strengths and what are your weaknesses
* What would you like to see this company improve
* Where do you see this company in five years

## Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
* If you don't see yourself in that job, speak to your personal self growth goals
