# Scrum - An Overview

* Plan, work and get feedback in small increments
* Build in "vertical slices" not in horizontal layers
* "Slices" represent working outcomes that solve a problem
  * How do you eat a hamburger?
  * Thin vertical slices!!
* Roles - Product Owner, ScrumMaster, development team (no titles)
  * No QA role, no tester, no developer, no documentation person, its all within the team
* Artifacts - Product Backlog, Working Software, Documentation, Tests
* Ceremonies - Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
  
## Product Owner

The product owner (single wringable neck) - They are the one who decides what is the next most valuable thing for the customer
They will pull from the top of the back log

### Backlog
* Product - Belongs to the Product Owner
  * Sprint - Once it gets to the sprint the work belongs to the team. (The Scrum Master will turn away extra work load on the team!)
    * Item
      * 13 points
    * Item
      * 17 points
    * Item
      * 12 points
    * Item
      * 11 points
  * Daily Ceremony
    * What did we do?
    * What are we going to do?
    * What could prevent us from doing it? (Impediment Removal)
  * Done!
    * Review with Product Owner - Does this look like what we were supposed to make? 
      * Acceptance Criteria - You can show this earlier in the sprint when laying out points

## Three Roles
* Product Owner - (Owns the What)
  * Responsible for Product Backlog - stories that express and capture valuable solutions to customer problems
  * Not a manager for the team
* Development Team - (Owns the How)
  * Should have members who possess all skills needed to create desired solutions
  * Should not have functional silos - cross-functional
    * T shaped people - You have a lot of expertise in something, but you have a shallow expertise in everything
    * I shaped people - I am the master of databases - well we need you to do command line stuff today
* ScrumMaster - (Coaches the team to grow the team)
  * Supports the team in the practice of Scrum - You have to guide the team to trust each other - You have to build that team sense of togetherness
  * Helps the team ship great solutions (removing impediments)
  * Coaches the team on making and keeping agreements
  * Another purpose for the Daily Stand Up Meeting is to begin creating constant communication to get growth
    * After a day or two the rest of the team chimes in with asking if they can support you because you might hold them up
    * If that member is not willing to share the work, that's a blinking red light to the manager
    * Sometimes there is an issue with management over the person's want to work as a team player
    * It's also not always about how many lines of code they've written, it's about the efficiency of the team

## How It Works
* Outcome(s) identified - what problems can we solve?
* Slice into User stories
* Product Owner priorities stories with customer
* Team estimates and accepts stories
* Team works the selected stories in priority order - Team should work on finishing the most important thing first
* Review stories for "Done-ness" and Acceptance - "Done-ness" is up to the team - Product owner accepts the "Done-ness" overall afterwards
* Retrospect on the work done to learn and improve - Usually 2 hour time box - Koombayah Moment - Open and Informal
  * Things they liked and things they didn't like on sticky notes then put them on the board.
  * Sometimes it can be able people and the team and personal issues
    * I didn't like how you made fun of me at the daily meetings
  * Sometimes it can be the processes
    * Can we speed up this part of the process

## As a Team Member...
* High level - work is "pulled" onto sprint, not pushed
  * If you feel like work is being pushed onto you, you won't be creating things of value, you're just trying to clear your plate
* Team estimates and makes commitment, not made by manager on behalf of the team
* Feedback and progress happen every sprint, not once a quarter/6 months/year
* Development time is protected during the sprint - interruptions are actively discouraged
* Teams are built to work collaboratively
