Notes from Day 12 of Digital Crafts Bootcamp

Review of Basic CSS/HTML

	<nav><header><footer> tags are more modern HTML tags

	Fitz-wisdom: Right click an image in vscode to copy the src of it.

	DON’T FORGET THE VIEWPORT TAG! Necessary for Responsive Design.

	Greenfield - Brand New Project

		Mostly in the start up realm.

	Brownfield - Maintenance of Old Projects

		Mostly in the enterprise realm.

	Azam - 10 years, 4 Greenfield projects

	You will spend an equal amount of time in Chrome Developer Tools as you will
		be actually coding.

	align-content - is more for wrapped content

Bootstrap

	Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly
		build out an app that functions as a framework to build off of.

	Keep in mind, a lot of stuff built off of bootstrap looks the same.

	get bootstrap.com => Getting Started => Starter Template

	Notice: It pulls from bootstrap cdn, and if bootstrap is down, your site is down…

	GCDT - Network Tab - Displays everything downloaded

	the min (minification) file will take away all the space to save storage for CSS.

	If you don’t like the styles of bootstrap, you have to override the bootstrap
		inline. It depends on who loads first if you’re adding your own file and
		leaving it up to global declarations. You just make sure that your file is
		loaded after the bootstrap file - aka - link your file below the bootstrap file.

	There are a lot of bootstrap theme builders, you can google them, use
		bootstrap for a minimal amount of your code, whatever you want!

	GCDT - You can select to see the media queries in the responsive section

	Go through the components in bootstrap to find different things to pull from.
		Card
		Badge
		Button
		
	Integrity Tag - Doesn’t allow you to change the CSS. It’s a new tag. If it is
		pointing to this algorithm, then it will not load the file. Mostly about the
		security of the application then anything else.

	Bootstrap is mostly experimental, just play around with it.

Themes!

	themeforest.net - website themes.

		Recommendation: Spend your time creating things for your portfolio rather
			than creating your own.

	GitHub should be up to date!! It is your resume + your portfolio!!

Sass

	sass-lang.com

	Sass is like CSS with more features. It’s not CSS, but you have to write in the
		language, then convert it into CSS so the browser can understand it.

	Nesting in Sass is a lot more readable. It helps with some missing features that
		are not included in CSS now, but will probably be implemented in the
		future.

	Has a .scss file type
	
	You will not type anything into the CSS file, you’ll just type things into the sass
		file, and it will convert and transport it into the css file.

	Terminal Command to write over your code to your CSS

		sass my-site.scss sit.css

	Partials - you can create a partial sass file, and implement that into the CSS
		This is when you only need sass for a certain part of your site, and then to
		apply that to your overall site.

	Inheritance - Same as in python, you can inherit from the parent class.
		You can create shared styles, and then give them to other classes and ids
