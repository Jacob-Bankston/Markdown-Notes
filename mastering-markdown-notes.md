Everything in markdown, if it doesn't work as normal, you can usually just put in the html, and it will work as well.

Be sure there is a space between them so they do not create Headings!

## Code Blocks

Here is my code!
```js
var x = 100;
const dog = 'snickers';
```
```php
$age = 50;
$name = "jacob";
echo strtoupper($name);
```

```
echo "hello"
```
It won't know that language, but that's okay!

Hey did you try `var x = 100;`?

Inline code!!

```diff
var x = 100;
- var y = 200;
+ var y = 300;
```

Shows the differences of what to add and what to take out!
