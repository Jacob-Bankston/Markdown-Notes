#Career Week Notes

## Full Time Employment (FTE)
The larger company you go into the more benefits they will provide you. The bonuses would usually be much better than being a consultant or a contractor. Your overall base pay might be lower, but your overall benefit structure might be better.

## Consultant
* TekSystems - they will try to keep you in this area
* Accenture - they will send you anywhere
* Sogeti - they will try to keep you in this area
* cPanel

You would be employed full time, but they will try and find you a client through their company. When you are hired from one of these companies, your base pay might be higher, but there is a possibility that your benefits might not be as good as the Full Time Employment (FTE) at a company hiring you outright.

This would also be a good opportunity to work with multiple clients. You will get an opportunity to work on different projects in a shorter span.

Azam always recommends working for a consultant group because you will get a lot more experience in a shorter amount of time.

If they do not have a project lined up for you, then you're on the 'bench'. The longer you're on the bench, the more you become a liability. The longer that this takes there is a chance that they will lay you off.

They might toss you into a different kind of project than one you're comfortable with, and if you're not flexible it increases the chances that they will lay you off as well.

For consultant workers, it is assumed that you will be working faster and better than their full time employees. You are billing them hourly, and they expect that to be reimbursed. Don't compare yourself to the full time employees because the companies have different expectations for you.

When you are going into the job, you are treated differently than the people that are full time employees over you. The larger the company, the more backwards the company is for discrimination towards consultants/contractors. It's not like this for every company that you go to, but just be aware that this is something that happens.

Depending on the company you are expected to learn really quickly and there will usually be a mentor person in place to catch you up on the project.

## Rights
If you are working for a company then they have the rights to the things that you build if they have that non-compete clause.

## Experience
As you go through your developer career, your experience and skills will grow and become the new focus of your developer identity over your github profile.

## Independent Contractor - Freelance
An Independent Contractor will charge $150~200 an hour depending on the person. They will have to accommodate all of their own Medical, Dental, Vision benefits for themselves and cover the holidays as well.

## Contract to Hire
This will be somewhere in between both contracting and freelance. You won't have any benefits to  Be careful to read what the terms are for the contract, and they might string you along without having to put as much money toward you.

## What to look for in a job
* Base Pay
* Medical Benefits - sometimes there is a 90 day gap for coverage on insurance (ask for a sign up bonus to cover the costs)
* Vision
* Dental
* 401 K (Retirement Plan) Matching contribution 6% (Contribute the maximum to get the matching that they give you!)
* Profit Sharing
* Bonus
* Remote Work - harder to find when you are starting out - your job is to try and find a position where you can be mentored
* Education Allowance/Stipend - a stipend that you can spend on a conference or a training
* Sign up Bonus - A bonus that the company will give you for staying at the company for a certain amount of time
* College Education Expense - Recommends a MBA kind of degree that you can use later in your career

## Job Offer
* Base Pay - whoever says a number first is the winner in the game - give a range - confidential information from your last employer

Offered: 80K
Vacation Offered: 1 Week

Counter Offer: 90K
Vacation Counter Offer: 3 Weeks

Offered: 90K
Vacation Counter Offer: 2 Weeks

Grab onto two things and stick with those two things.

Always say that you are going to think about it. Never look too needy that you're desperate for the position.

* Remote Work
* Vacation
* Sign Up Bonus

## Leaving a Job
Always leave on good terms.
Give a two weeks notice. Technically you can just leave, but it helps the company be able to transition.
If they can not find a person in two weeks, you've already given them notice that you were leaving, you are not obligated to wait until they can find someone to fit that role.
Work harder in these last two weeks, so you don't give the perception that you don't care, and you leave the company on a high note.

## Hourly/Weekly/Fixed Price

###Hourly
Let's say you're charing $50 an hour.

- Build a login system - 4 x 50 = $200

2 years later

- Build a login system - 2 x 100 = $200
- Build a login system - 2 x 150 = $300

The problem is there's a limit to the amount that you can charge hourly. When you get to $200 or more people will stop taking you seriously. 

Whenever you are charging hourly, it is in your best interest to take more time, and the client's interest is to have you take a shorter time.

The more experience you have, the more that you are punishing yourself for an hourly rate.

### Fixed Price
Let's say you're charging $5000 for a video conferencing app.
They will give you a deadline of when they need it, let's say 2 weeks.
You can take 2 days to finish the project, but you will still be paid for what you agreed on.

Scope Creep - customers asking for more than what you originally agreed upon.

You want to be sure that you have everything on the contract for every small detail that they want. If they try to add more to the project then you can have something to back you up that you did not include that in the initial discussion.

### Contingency Rates
You can add a 20% additional rate to the cost if there is something that is a gap in the project details that you did not agree upon.

### Value Pricing
You go to a big company and they know the value of what the project is going to be saving them in the future. Say it is a big project in that will save the company 10% on costs for that machine annually and you ask for 5% of the costs. This could be $100,000, but it will be worth it for the company in the long run. You can also make assurances that if it doesn't save them at least 5% then you will let them use the project for free.

## Work Environment
Check out the other developers or lead developers when you are going to go work for a company so you will get a sense about the work environment at that company.

## First Job
For your first job you may take the job to gain the experience, then you will get more picky about what kind of career and work environment that you would like to.

At a certain point when you're making more money the money will become less important to you over time.

What kind of project are you working on?
Are you passionate about the things you are working on?

If you don't enjoy your first job, take a year to learn then start seeking out other opportunities.

You don't have to be the best in anything, you just need to find what you have experience and skills in that can be joined together to make a rare combination that you can fit into.

## Struggle
It is okay to struggle. This is the normal and common feeling for learning new things. The only way to truly learn something is to slowly struggle through figuring and tinkering with the new concepts and materials. Learning is slow and difficult for everyone, don't let it discourage you.

Don't try to compare yourself with another person. In the long game, it is the people who are persistent and dedicated that will succeed in the end. The short term game is not going to do anything for you in the larger scope of things.

Always think about the long term benefits, that's how you will succeed.

## Applying
Send in your resume and cover letter tailored to each and every job. Spend the time to hit up 15 jobs applications in a day over sending out 100 of the same resume.

## Career Services and Job Search Tools
There's a lot of resources from the folder inside the Resume Resources and Portfolio Resources. Seek out opportunities to network, get business cards and use the team at Digital Crafts for support.

## Business Cards 
You want to put your portfolio on your business card and limit the number of ways to reach out and contact you on it.
