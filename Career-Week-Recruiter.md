# Recruiters, How Do They Work?

## Recruiters work on different positions for different companies throughout Houston
* They may be back-filling for a person who is already in the role at the company.
* You can only work with one recruiting firm at a time, and the company will usually go with the first recruiter or throw out your resume
* Advice - Try to find a recruiter that you can trust and have a good relationship
  * Use them as your main resource
  * Still take calls from other recruiters because they will not be on all jobs at all times

## How many interviews does the average Junior Developer go through before being hired
* Depends on each company.
  * Some companies are desperate and look for a one and done interview process.
    * Make sure that you ask a lot of questions!
    * If you can take a day or two to think of any questions that you have, that's optimal.
  * Some companies are wishy-washy and just want a talent pool to pull from.

## Job Description
* A job description is a wish list for a candidate, not necessarily a requirement list.
  * If someone applies with all of those facets, they're probably going to hire them on the spot.
* If you fit 70~75% of the job description you're probably a good fit for the job.
  * Typically the Degrees or Years of Experience are preferred more than an actual must have.
  
## Questions to ask
* Something that tells the person you've done your research and are really engaged!
* You need to ask questions or you are conveying that you are not interested in the position.
* DO NOT: Stay clear from work times, compensation and vacation days

## Job Postings
* Applying to similar roles is okay, but don't apply for completely disjunct roles at the same company

## When should you take Contract Work over Full Time Work
* This is really based on personal situations!
* A lot of Contract Roles are going to be pay without benefits
* Some companies plan a rate inside of the pay to be able to give out benefits to contract employees
* Keep in mind that contract employees are the first ones to let go, it's better on numbers to let go of a contractor for finances and unemployment rates
* Contract work is typically paid a bit higher if you can work off of your significant other's benefits
* If long term you want to be in a full-time position, be cognizant of how many contracts you've taken on.
  * It's a red-flag if you take on a lot of contract work about whether or not you can stay around in one spot for a long time.

## Most effective negotiation strategies
* Number one benefit of working with a recruiting team is going to be pushing for the highest wages possible.
  * They can send you over with a salary requirement for you.
