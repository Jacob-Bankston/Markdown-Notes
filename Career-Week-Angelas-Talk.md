## Still Build it Yourself...

It's okay to borrow design inspiration from elsewhere, but we still believe you should be building your portfolio yourself. A purchased template might be better than nothing, but an employer will know.

## Optimize Like a Pro

Employers may look under the hood of your portfolio, and if they find giant images, poorly written or documented code, etc... it's a problem.

Page load speed is important, make sure it's mobile responsive.

## Resize images

Resize your images to less than 350kb

Unless you're using transparency, images should be JPGs, not PNGs.

## Fix all of your console errors and warnings!

## What should it contain?

1. About - include a picture and what makes you you!
2. Featured Project with a Walkthrough Video - This is hugely important, it can go in emails to other employers too!!
3. Other Projects - 2~4 projects that you're proud of.
4. Skills / Tech - Do NOT rate yourself for any given skill... that's the interviewer's job, no yours!!
5. Contact Info - Do not include your address. Long commutes can hurt your odds. [This also counts for your resume! Just your city/state]

## About

ATS compatibility!! You may be passed over because your resume doesn't fit into the guidelines of the formatting search that companies use.

Play with margins that have enough space, but doesn't look too cramped.

Try to use bold text to highlight the text that you want to be highlighted.

Having a well organized resume is very important to acheive this.

Projects, Technologies, Professional Experience, Summary, Education, Volunteer Experience
