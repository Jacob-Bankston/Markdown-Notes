RESEARCH - Unit Testing versus User Interface Testing

Functions

	Make the functions simple and reusable, even if you aren’t using them
		multiple times in the code, it still is beneficial in the long run
		to create cleaner code.

	Add a comment of what you need to do next to “show your work”. It
		communicates what you are going for overall to other people,
		even it your code doesn’t work yet.

	It’s not necessary or mandatory that you always write comments, you
		only need a comment when you have something that is complicated.
		It’s like a comedian trying to explain his jokes. If the function name is 
		display_all_shopping_lists() you probably know what it means.

Files

	Save JSON file names as a variable, in case your manager/boss wants to
		change the file name. That way you are only having to change
		one line of code, instead of 30.

	Reminder: JSON files are only on root value. A single array, with
		with dictionaries nested, or a dictionary with nested arrays, etc…
		https://jsonlint.com/ - use this website to check if it’s JSON

Operator

	The formatting operator for formatting a string doesn’t have to be
		placed inside a print statement. It can be used for any string
		that you are defining.

Life Tips from Azam

	When you are researching something to implement into your project,
		create a smaller file to test the code that you want to utilize to make
		sure that it works first, rather than trying to implement it in your
		project. You need to understand the logic behind the code and what
		it does first before you can appropriately implement it into your
		code.

CODING PROJECT IDEA - Google Voice Kit + Raspberry Pi + Voice Recognition + Perfect Pitch Activity - Hearing your audio => Translating to a frequency range => matching that to a letter name pitch. Giving user a pitch to sing, and having the user attempt to sing the correct pitch. Vice Versa. Playing a pitch and having the user speak the correct pitch (flat or sharps allowed)
