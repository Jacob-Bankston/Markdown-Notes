##Functions

Make the functions simple and reusable, even if you aren’t using them multiple times in the code, it still is beneficial in the long run to create cleaner code.

Add a comment of what you need to do next to “show your work”. It communicates what you are going for overall to other people, even it your code doesn’t work yet.

It’s not necessary or mandatory that you always write comments, you only need a comment when you have something that is complicated. It’s like a comedian trying to explain his jokes. If the function name is `display_all_shopping_lists()` you probably know what it means.

##Files

Save JSON file names as a variable, in case your manager/boss wants to change the file name. That way you are only having to change one line of code, instead of 30.

**Reminder**: JSON files are only on root value. A single array, with with dictionaries nested, or a dictionary with nested arrays, etc… https://jsonlint.com/ - use this website to check if it’s JSON

##Operator

The formatting operator for formatting a string doesn’t have to be placed inside a print statement. It can be used for any string that you are defining.

##Life Tips from Azam

When you are researching something to implement into your project, create a smaller file to test the code that you want to utilize to make sure that it works first, rather than trying to implement it in your project. You need to understand the logic behind the code and what it does first before you can appropriately implement it into your code.
