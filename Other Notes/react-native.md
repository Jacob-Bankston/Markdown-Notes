# React Native Meetup 7-30-19

## Expo

This is a service that does a lot of the front end heavy lifting for you to create the files and structure that you need to set up your application.

Create a React Native App. It saves you hours of boiler plate building.

Expo works better on android and ios platforms using the web app utilities in firebase

Every time that you change your code it reloads the data an refreshes. This makes it so you don't have to rebuild and make it on a virtual machine every time.

## Firebase

Using the Firebase npm to attach the config file over.

Uses firebase to create a backend for the react native application.

Recommendation is to use Firebase Firestore as the database

Use the Firebase app documentation - it's great! You know it's good.

Install the SDK using a Module Bundler from the Getting Started Guide - https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup
